Description: A facility to generate balanced semi-Latin rectangles with any cell size (preferably up to ten) with given number of treatments, see Uto, N.P. and Bailey, R.A. (2020). "Balanced Semi-Latin rectangles: properties, existence and constructions for block size two". Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice, 14(3), 1-11, <doi:10.1007/s42519-020-00118-3>. It also provides facility to generate partially balanced semi-Latin rectangles for cell size 2, 3 and 4 for any number of treatments.
Note: This package is developed as part of ongoing Ph.D (Agricultural
